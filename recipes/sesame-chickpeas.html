    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 ounce cans chickpeas</li>
        <li> 3-4 large cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup low sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger or 2 tsp fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tapioca starch</li>
        <li>¼ cup low sodium vegetable broth water divided</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes optional for spice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain and rinse the chickpeas and set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>Mince the garlic and add to a sauté pan with the avocado or olive oil. I suggest using a
        garlic press
        so it's very finely minced and you don't end up with any large pieces in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Sauté for a few minutes or until the garlic is very fragrant. 
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the tapioca starch and half of the vegetable broth and mix until no clumps remain. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>To the sauté pan with the garlic, add in the low sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, maple syrup, rice vinegar, ginger, and the additional 2 tbsp of vegetable broth. Whisk together. 
        </li>
        <li>Add in the tapioca mixture and stir. 
        </li>
        <li>When bubbles start to form, add in the chickpeas and stir until they are well coated. 
        </li>
        <li>Cook on low heat until the sauce becomes thick and sticky, about 5 minutes. stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let sit to allow the chickpeas to absorb all of the flavor. 
        </li>
        <li>Serve with steamed broccoli, quinoa, or rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
